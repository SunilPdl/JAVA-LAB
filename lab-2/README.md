# Constructor in Java
Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object. A constructor resembles an instance method in java but it’s not a method as it doesn’t have a return type. 
## Types of Constructors
There are two types of constructors: Default , Parameterized and Copy

1. Default constructor
If you do not implement any constructor in your class, Java compiler inserts a default constructor into your code on your behalf. This constructor is known as default constructor.

2. Parameterized constructor
Constructor with arguments(or you can say parameters) is known as Parameterized constructor.

3. Copy constructor
A copy constructor in a Java class is a constructor that creates an object using another object of the same Java class. That's helpful when we want to copy a complex object that has several fields, or when we want to make a deep copy of an existing object.

# Final keyword
In the Java programming language, the final keyword is used in several contexts to define an entity that can only be assigned once. Once a final variable has been assigned, it always contains the same value.
