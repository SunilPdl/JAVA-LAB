# INHERITANCE AND ABSTRACT CLASS

###  Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.
Types of inheritance in java
On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java : single, multilevel and hierarchical.
* Single Inheritance
When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance. In the example given below, Dog class inherits the Animal class, so there is the single inheritance.
- Multilevel Inheritance Example
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. As you can see in the example given below, BabyDog class inherits the Dog class which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.
- Hierarchical Inheritance Example
When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance. In the example given below, Dog and Cat classes inherits the Animal class, so there is hierarchical inheritance.

###  Abstraction in Java
Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.The properties and behaviors of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.
